I'll explain the complete EdgeDetector application architecture, functionality of each component, and provide step-by-step running instructions.

# Architecture Overview

The application consists of three main components:

1. Android App (Camera + Processing)
2. Native C++ Code (OpenCV Edge Detection)
3. Web Viewer (Real-time Display)

Let me break down each component:

## 1. Android Application Files

### CameraActivity.java

- Main Android activity
- Handles camera initialization and preview
- Key functionalities:
  - Uses Camera2 API for camera access
  - Captures frames from camera in YUV format
  - Processes frames through JNI (calls C++ code)
  - Displays processed frames using OpenGL
  - Streams frames to web viewer via WebSocket

### WebSocketServer.java

- WebSocket server implementation
- Functionalities:
  - Runs on port 8765
  - Streams processed frames to web clients
  - Handles client connections/disconnections
  - Encodes frames as base64 for transmission

### CMakeLists.txt

- CMake build configuration
- Links OpenCV libraries
- Configures JNI build settings

## 2. Native C++ Component

### edge_detector.cpp

- Native C++ implementation using OpenCV
- Key functionalities:
  - Receives YUV frames from Java
  - Converts frames to BGR format
  - Applies Canny edge detection
  - Returns processed frames as PNG data
  - Uses JNI for Java-C++ communication

## 3. Web Viewer Component

### app.ts

- TypeScript implementation of web viewer
- Functionalities:
  - Connects to Android WebSocket server
  - Displays real-time processed frames
  - Shows processing statistics
  - Provides controls for refresh and mode toggle

### index.html

- Web viewer UI
- Components:
  - Frame display area
  - Statistics panel
  - Control buttons
  - Status messages

# Step-by-Step Running Instructions

## 1. Prerequisites Installation

```powershell
# 1. Install Android Studio
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio

# 2. Install Node.js
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/

# 3. Install OpenCV Android SDK
# Download from: https://opencv.org/releases/
```

## 2. Project Setup

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gokulkumarv24/Android-development.git
cd EdgeDetectorApp

# 2. Setup Android project
# Open Android Studio
# Import project from EdgeDetectorApp folder
# Wait for Gradle sync to complete

# 3. Setup Web viewer
cd web
npm install
```

## 3. Configure OpenCV

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to File > Project Structure
3. Under SDK Location, set OpenCV SDK path
4. Update `CMakeLists.txt` with correct OpenCV path

## 4. Build and Run

### A. Android App

1. Open Android Studio
2. Connect Android device with USB debugging enabled
3. Build and run the app:

```powershell
# In Android Studio:
Click Run 'app' button or press Shift+F10
```

4. Grant permissions:
   - Allow camera access when prompted
   - Allow internet access when prompted

### B. Web Viewer

```powershell
# 1. Build web viewer
cd EdgeDetectorApp/web
npm run build

# 2. Start web server
npm run serve
```

## 5. Connect Components

1. Find Android device IP:

```powershell
# Option 1: In device settings
Settings > About phone > Status > IP address

# Option 2: Using ADB
adb shell ip addr show wlan0
```

2. Access web viewer:

- On same device: http://localhost:8080
- From another device: http://[android-device-ip]:8080

## 6. Verify Operation

1. Check Android app:

   - Camera preview should be visible
   - Edge detection overlay should appear
   - Log should show "WebSocket server started"

2. Check web viewer:
   - Should show "Connected to camera feed"
   - Frame display should update in real-time
   - Statistics should update

## 7. Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

1. Check Android permissions:

```powershell
adb shell pm list permissions | grep -E "camera|internet"
```

2. Verify WebSocket connection:

```powershell
# Test WebSocket server
wscat -c ws://[android-device-ip]:8765
```

3. Check Android logs:

```powershell
adb logcat | grep EdgeDetector
```

4. Check web console:

```
Press F12 in browser > Console tab
Look for WebSocket related messages
```

## 8. Development Tips

1. For Android changes:

   - Edit in Android Studio
   - Instant Run will update app

2. For web viewer changes:

```powershell
# Run in watch mode
npm run watch

# In another terminal
npm run serve
```

3. For C++ changes:
   - Edit in Android Studio
   - Clean and rebuild project
